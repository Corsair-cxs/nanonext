Title: NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen) Lightweight Messaging Library
Version: 0.10.2.9016
Description: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG
    implements Scalability Protocols, a reliable, high-performance messaging
    standard. Provides for common communications needs including
    publish/subscribe, request/reply and service discovery, over in-process,
    IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. As its own threaded
    concurrency framework, offers an intuitive toolkit for asynchronous
    programming and distributed computing, utilising 'aio' objects which resolve
    automatically upon completion, and synchronisation primitives which allow R
    to wait upon concurrent messaging threads.
