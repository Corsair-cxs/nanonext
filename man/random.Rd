\usage{
random(n = 1L, convert = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{[default 1L] integer random bytes to generate.}

\item{convert}{[default TRUE] logical FALSE to return a raw vector, or TRUE
to return the hex representation of the bytes as a character string.}
}
\value{
A length 'n' raw vector, or length one vector of '2n' random
    characters, depending on the value of 'convert' supplied.
}
\description{
Strictly not for use in statistical analysis. Non-reproducible and with
    unknown statistical properties. Provides an alternative source of
    randomness from the Mbed TLS library for purposes such as cryptographic
    key generation. Mbed TLS uses a block-cipher counter-mode based
    deterministic random bit generator as specified in NIST SP800-90. It
    requires an external source of entropy, for which an entropy accumulator
    design has been implemented.
}
\details{
If 'n' is non-integer, it will be coerced to integer; if a vector,
    only the first element will be used.
}
\note{
Results obtained are independent of and do not alter the state of R's
    own pseudo-random number generators.
