R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is a socket library providing high-performance scalability protocols, implementing a cross-platform standard for messaging and communications. Serves as a concurrency framework that can be used for building distributed systems.

Designed for performance and reliability, the NNG library is written in C and {nanonext} is a lightweight wrapper depending on no other packages. Supported transports include inproc (intra-process), IPC (inter-process), TCP/IP (IPv4 or IPv6), and WebSocket. The inproc transport uses zero-copy where possible for a much faster solution than alternatives.

Can be used for sending data across networks, but equally as an interface for code and processes to communicate with each other. Receive data generated in Python, perform analysis in R, and send results to a C++ program â€“ all on the same computer or on networks spanning the globe.

### Installation

Install the latest release from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nanonext")
```

or the development version from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nanonext", repos = "https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev")
```

### Interfaces

{nanonext} offers 2 equivalent interfaces: an object-oriented interface, and a functional interface.

#### Object-oriented Interface

The primary object in the object-oriented interface is the nano object. Use `nano()` to create a nano object which encapsulates a Socket and Dialer/Listener. Methods such as `$send()` or `$recv()` can then be accessed directly from the object.

*Example using Request/Reply (REQ/REP) protocol with inproc transport:*

Create nano objects:

```{r example}
library(nanonext)
nano1 <- nano("req", listen = "inproc://nanonext")
nano2 <- nano("rep", dial = "inproc://nanonext")
```

Send message from 'nano1':

```{r send}
nano1$send("hello world!")
```

Receive message using 'nano2':

```{r recv}
nano2$recv()
```

#### Functional Interface 

The primary object in the functional interface is the Socket. Use `socket()` to create a socket, and optionally dial or listen at an address. The socket is then passed as the first argument of subsequent actions such as `send()` or `recv()`.

*Example using Pipeline (Push/Pull) protocol with TCP/IP transport:*

Create sockets:

```{r example2}
library(nanonext)
socket1 <- socket("push", listen = "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
socket2 <- socket("pull", dial = "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
```

Send message from 'socket1':

```{r send2}
send(socket1, "hello world!")
```

Receive message using 'socket2':

```{r recv2}
recv(socket2)
```

### Cross-language Exchange

{nanonext} provides a fast and reliable data interface between different programming languages where NNG has a binding, including C, C++, Python, Go, Rust etc. 

The following example demonstrates the exchange of numerical data between R and Python (NumPy), two of the most commonly-used languages for data science and machine learning. 

Using a messaging interface provides a clean and robust approach which is light on resources and offers limited and identifiable points of failure. This is especially relevant when processing real-time data, as an example. 

This approach can also serve as an interface / pipe between different processes written in the same or different languages, running on the same computer or distributed across networks, and is an enabler of modular software design as espoused by the Unix philosophy.

Create socket in Python using the NNG binding 'pynng':

```{python rnpy1}
import numpy as np
import pynng
socket = pynng.Pair0(listen="ipc:///tmp/nanonext.socket")
```

Create nano object in R using {nanonext}, then send a vector of 'doubles', specifying mode as 'raw':

```{r rnpy2}
library(nanonext)
n <- nano("pair", dial = "ipc:///tmp/nanonext.socket")
n$send(c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5), mode = "raw")
```

Receive in Python as a NumPy array of 'floats', and send back to R:

```{python rnpy3}
raw = socket.recv()
array = np.frombuffer(raw)
print(array)

msg = array.tobytes()
socket.send(msg)
```

Receive in R, specifying the receive mode as 'double':

```{r rnpy4}
n$recv(mode = "double")
```

### Async and Concurrency

{nanonext} implements true async send and receive, leveraging NNG as a massively-scalable concurrency framework.

`send_aio()` and `recv_aio()` functions return immediately but perform their operations async. Their results can be called using `call_aio()` when required.

```{r async}
library(nanonext)
s1 <- socket("pair", listen = "inproc://nano")
s2 <- socket("pair", dial = "inproc://nano")

```

For a 'sendAio' object, calling the result causes it to be stored in the AIO as `$result`. An exit code of 0 denotes a successful send.

```{r async2}

res <- send_aio(s1, data.frame(a = 1, b = 2))
res
call_aio(res)
res
res$result

```

For a 'recvAio' object, calling the message causes it to be stored in the AIO as `$raw` and/or `$data` as the case may be.

```{r async3}

msg <- recv_aio(s2)
msg
call_aio(msg)
msg
msg$data

```

The values can also be accessed directly from the call as per the example below:

```{r async4}

call_aio(msg)$data

close(s1)
close(s2)

```

### RPC and Distributed Computing

{nanonext} implements remote procedure calls (RPC) using NNG's req/rep protocol to provide a basis for distributed computing. 

Can be used to perform computationally-expensive calculations or I/O-bound operations such as writing large amounts of data to disk in a separate 'server' process running concurrently.

Server process: `reply()` will wait for a message and apply a function, in this case `rnorm()`, before sending back the result.

```{r rpcserver, eval=FALSE}

library(nanonext)
rep <- socket("rep", listen = "tcp://127.0.0.1:6546")
ctxp <- context(rep)
reply(ctxp, execute = rnorm, send_mode = "raw") 

```

Client process: `request()` performs an async send and receive request and returns immediately with a `recvAio` object.

```{r rpcclient}

library(nanonext)
req <- socket("req", dial = "tcp://127.0.0.1:6546")
ctxq <- context(req)
aio <- request(ctxq, data = 1e8, recv_mode = "double", keep.raw = FALSE)

```

At this point, the client can run additional code concurrent with the server processing the request. 
```{r rpcclient2}
# do more...
```

When the result of the server calculation is required, the `recvAio` may be called using `call_aio()`.

The return value from the server request is then retrieved and stored in the Aio as `$data`.

```{r rpcclient3}

call_aio(aio)

aio
str(aio$data)

```

In this example the calculation is returned, but other operations may reside entirely on the server side, for example writing data to disk.

In such a case, using `call_aio()` confirms that the operation has completed (or it will wait for completion) and calls the return value of the function, which may typically be NULL or an exit code.

### Publisher Subscriber Model

{nanonext} fully implements NNG's pub/sub protocol as per the below example. 

This example uses the new R4.1 pipe for clarity of code, although this is of course not required.

```{r pub}

pub <- socket("pub", listen = "inproc://nanobroadcast")
sub <- socket("sub", dial = "inproc://nanobroadcast")

sub |> subscribe(topic = "examples")
pub |> send(c("examples", "this is an example"), mode = "raw", echo = FALSE)
sub |> recv(mode = "character", keep.raw = FALSE)

pub |> send(c("other", "this other topic will not be received"), mode = "raw", echo = FALSE)
sub |> recv(mode = "character", keep.raw = FALSE)

# specify NULL to subscribe to ALL topics
sub |> subscribe(topic = NULL)
pub |> send(c("newTopic", "this is a new topic"), mode = "raw", echo = FALSE)
sub |> recv("character", keep.raw = FALSE)

sub |> unsubscribe(topic = NULL)
pub |> send(c("newTopic", "this topic will now not be received"), mode = "raw", echo = FALSE)
sub |> recv("character", keep.raw = FALSE)

# however the topics explicitly subscribed to are still received
pub |> send(c("examples", "this example will still be received"), mode = "raw", echo = FALSE)
sub |> recv(mode = "character", keep.raw = FALSE)

close(pub)
close(sub)

```

### ncurl Minimalist http Client

`ncurl()` is a minimalistic http(s) client. It takes only one argument, the URL. It can follow redirects.

```{r ncurl}

ncurl("http://httpbin.org/headers")

```

### Building from source

#### Linux / Mac / Solaris

Installation from source requires the C library 'libnng' along with its development headers.

This is available in system package repositories as:

-   `libnng-dev` (deb)
-   `nng-devel` (rpm)
-   `nng` (Homebrew on MacOS)
-   `nng` from vcpkg (see <https://vcpkg.io/>).

A system installation of 'libnng' in the standard filesystem locations will be detected and used if possible.

Otherwise, a release version of 'libnng' will be downloaded and built from source automatically during package installation (note: this requires 'cmake').

#### Windows

Pre-built libraries (for i386 / x64 / x64-UCRT) are automatically downloaded during the package installation process.
