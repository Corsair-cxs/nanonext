R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is a socket library providing high-performance scalability protocols, or common communication patterns, the basic building blocks for distributed systems.

Designed for performance and reliability, the NNG library is written in C and {nanonext} is a light-weight wrapper with no external package dependencies. Supported transports include inproc (intra-process), IPC (inter-process), TCP/IP (IPv4 or IPv6), and WebSocket.

Can be used for sending data across networks, but equally as an interface for code and processes to communicate with each other. Receive data generated in Python, perform analysis in R, and send results to a C++ program â€“ all on the same computer or on networks spanning the globe.

### Installation

Install the latest version of {nanonext} from rOpenSci R-universe:

```{r runiv, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nanonext", repos = "https://shikokuchuo.r-universe.dev")
```

or the Github source:

```{r github, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("shikokuchuo/nanonext")
```

### Interfaces

{nanonext} offers 2 equivalent interfaces: an object-oriented interface, and a functional interface.

#### Object-oriented Interface

The primary object in the object-oriented interface is the nano object. Use `nano()` to create a nano object which encapsulates a Socket and Dialer/Listener. Methods such as `$send()` or `$recv()` can then be accessed directly from the object.

*Example using Request/Reply (REQ/REP) protocol with inproc transport:*

Create nano objects:

```{r example}
library(nanonext)
nano1 <- nano("req", listen = "inproc://nanonext")
nano2 <- nano("rep", dial = "inproc://nanonext")
```

Send message from 'nano1':

```{r send}
nano1$send("hello world!")
```

Receive message using 'nano2':

```{r recv}
nano2$recv()
```

#### Functional Interface 

The primary object in the functional interface is the Socket. Use `socket()` to create a socket, and optionally dial or listen at an address. The socket is then passed as the first argument of subsequent actions such as `send()` or `recv()`.

*Example using Pipeline (Push/Pull) protocol with TCP/IP transport:*

Create sockets:

```{r example2}
library(nanonext)
socket1 <- socket("push", listen = "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
socket2 <- socket("pull", dial = "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
```

Send message from 'socket1':

```{r send2}
send(socket1, "hello world!")
```

Receive message using 'socket2':

```{r recv2}
recv(socket2)
```

### Building from source

#### Linux / Mac / Solaris

Installation from source requires the C library 'libnng' along with its development headers.

This is available in system package repositories as:

-   `libnng-dev` (deb)
-   `nng-devel` (rpm)
-   `nng` (Homebrew on MacOS)
-   `nng` from vcpkg (see <https://vcpkg.io/>).

A system installation of 'libnng' in the standard filesystem locations will be detected and used. <sup>(1)</sup>

Otherwise, a release version<sup>(2)</sup> of 'libnng'will be downloaded and built from source automatically during package installation (Note: this requires 'cmake' to be installed and on your $PATH).

#### Windows

Pre-built libraries (for i386 / x64 / x64-UCRT) are automatically downloaded during the package installation process.

#### Notes

1.  For building 'libnng' from source, ensure that 'cmake' uses the C compiler flag '-fPIC' by passing the option<br /> `-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -fPIC"` if required.
